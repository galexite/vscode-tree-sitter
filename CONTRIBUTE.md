# Contributing

## Basics

1. Have _VSCode >= 1.80_ and _Nodejs_ installed. I don't know the minimal Nodejs version required, but it works for me on _v18.12.1_

2. Have _C/C++_ compiler installed, I have _G++ 12.2.0_ and _Clang 14.0.6_ installed on a Fedora Linux

   - I haven't successfuled built this project on windows yet

3. Run `npm i`, `yarn install` or `pnpm i` depends on your tastes

4. Open the repo with _VSCode_, press _F5_ to start debugging

   - You can uncomment `// "--profile-temp",` inside `.vscode/launch.json` to debug in a clean environment

5. Open the code you want to render in the debugging VSCode window, the extension should work

## Advanced

### DebugHover

DebugHover can be enabled when debugging, there are 2 ways

1. Change the settings `syntax.debugHover.default` to `true` in `package.json`
2. Open a folder with debug vscode, add the following configuration to `.vscode/settings.json`
   ```json
   {
     "syntax": {
       "debugHover": "true"
     }
   }
   ```

### Gramma Explanation

There are `grammars/<grammar>.json` defined in this project, there are 2 main usage of the json files

#### Build tree sitter wasm plugins

When installing packages, nodejs should have built the wasm plugins for you under parsers folder, you can also run `pnpm run postinstall` to rebuild them.

The build script is `script/build.js`, it will load the json filename, remap to tree sitter plugin, call tree sitter binary to build and move the built files to parsers.

The remapping looks like

```json
{
  "csharp": {
    "module": ["c-sharp"],
    "output": "c_sharp"
  }
}
```

which means, the json file is `csharp.json`, the tree sitter module name is `tree-sitter-c-sharp`, the wasm filename is `tree-sitter-c_sharp.wasm`, and finally renamed to `csharp.wasm`

It's a bit confusing, but it worked for me to add a new language support for C# :)

#### Render the highlight at runtime

When the extension starts for a supported language, it will load the wasm to parse the document and gets the AST.The json file works like a brige between AST and VSCode.

For example, to make a C# foreach statement work, the AST structure looks like

```json
"complexTerms": [
  "identifier",
],
"complexScopes": {
  "for_each_statement > identifier[-2] ": "parameter",
}
```

The `complexTerms` tells the extension, when current token type is `identifier`, it could be the ending of a complex scope, so the extension will DFS the AST to find a longest scope that ends with `identifier` and exists in predefined `complexScopes`

The example complex scopes mean, the identifier is the second last of under a for each statement, take a real world example here

```C#
foreach (var x in digits)
```

There are 4 tokens inside the brackets, the AST paths are

```
var:    block > for_each_statement > implicit_type > "var"
x:      block > for_each_statement > identifier[0][-2]
in:     block > for_each_statement > "in"
digist: block > for_each_statement > identifier[1][-1]
```

So `x` is both the 0th and -2nd identifier inside `for_each_statement`, and we define this as `parameter`.

`parameter` is a extension-defined concept, in `extension.ts`, it's mapped to VSCode like

```typescript
termMap.set("parameter", { type: "parameter", modifiers: ["declaration"] });
```

Where type and modifiers are defined by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#scope-inspector), and how it looks like depends on your theme.

I have verified it works in Monokai theme with _italic_ style.

The `parameter` type also needs to be enabled in both `packages.json` and `TokensProvider.ts`
